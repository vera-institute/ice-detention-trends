# ICE Detention Trends Data
Vera’s [ICE Detention Trends]([url](http://vera.org/ice-detention-trends)) dashboard reveals an unprecedented level of detail about ICE detention populations, both nationally and in the 1,081 facilities in which ICE detained people, on each day between October 1, 2008, and March 30, 2020—fiscal year (FY) 2009 to mid-FY2020.
This repository
includes the aggregated data visualized in the dashboard, including information
on:

- Midnight population: the daily number of people detained at midnight
(nationally and by facility).
- 24-hour population: the number of people detained for any part of a given day,
including those whom ICE transferred or booked-out of custody before midnight
(nationally and by facility). While ICE relies solely on midnight populations in
its reporting, Vera includes both types of daily populations—midnight and
24-hour—as the two can differ drastically.
- Book-ins: the daily number of people ICE booked into custody (nationally).
- Book-outs: the daily number of people ICE booked out of custody (nationally).
- Facility names, locations, and types (as coded by ICE in other datasets).

## About the Data
The dashboard primarily draws from ICE detention datasets released through a
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, shared with Vera by David Hausman,
assistant professor of law, University of California, Berkeley. To overcome
limitations of the original data, Vera developed a novel algorithm to construct
individual detention histories, from a person's initial book-in to their
final-book out, inclusive of any transfers. Doing so allowed Vera to account for
duplicated data and compute detention populations. Vera drew from additional ICE
datasets for information on facility locations and facility types. Otherwise,
Vera chose to present the ICE detention data "as is" to the greatest extent
possible, including any inconsistencies or errors that may be present in the
data compiled and shared by ICE. For more information about the data and Vera's
methodology, see the accompanying technical appendix<!-- TODO: Link here -->.

2020, including midnight population, 24-hour population, book-ins, and
book-outs.

## `facility/`
### `FY20XX.csv`
Facility-level population statistics for each day between October 1, 2008, and March
30, 2020, including midnight population and 24-hour population.  To make file
sizes more manageable, Vera split the data into separate .csv files by fiscal
year (October 1 of the previous year through September 30 of a given year).
FY2020 is a partial fiscal year covering October 1, 2019, to March 30, 2020.
